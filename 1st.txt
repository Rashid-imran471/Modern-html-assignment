Some key features of HTML5:

1. Semantics: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, and <aside>. These elements help us to describe the structure and meaning of web content more accurately.
2. Multimedia Support: HTML5 includes native support for audio and video elements (<audio> and <video>), reducing the need for third-party plugins like Flash. It also supports various audio and video codecs.
3. Canvas: The <canvas> element provides a drawing surface for creating graphics, animations, and interactive content using JavaScript.
4. Scalability: HTML5 makes it easier to create responsive designs by introducing features like the <meta name="viewport"> tag for controlling how web pages are displayed on different devices and screen sizes.
5. Local Storage: The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs enable web applications to store data locally on the user's device, even after the browser is closed.
6. Offline Web Applications: HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (AppCache) and Service Workers, allowing web apps to work offline or with a poor internet connection by caching resources.
7. Geolocation: The Geolocation API allows websites to request and access the user's geographic location, enabling location-based services.
8. Form Enhancements: HTML5 introduced new input types (<input type="email">, <input type="date">, etc.) and attributes to improve form validation and user experience.
9. Web Workers: Web Workers enable multi-threading in web applications, allowing tasks to run in the background without affecting the main user interface.
10. Drag and Drop: HTML5 provides native support for drag-and-drop interactions, making it easier to create intuitive user interfaces.
11. Web Storage: Besides local storage, HTML5 introduced the sessionStorage API for storing data temporarily during a page session.
