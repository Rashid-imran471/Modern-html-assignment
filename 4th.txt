Improving the accessibility of HTML involves using markup and techniques that make web content more understandable and navigable for users with disabilities. Here are three ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

1. *Semantic HTML Elements*: Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure to your content. Examples include using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` tags to define the layout and hierarchy of your web page. These elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret the content correctly.

2. *Alt Text for Images*: Always include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images using the `alt` attribute within the `<img>` element. Alt text provides a textual description of the image content, making it accessible to users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers.

3. *Proper Use of Headings*: Organize your content using heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) in a hierarchical manner. Headings should reflect the logical structure of your content, with `<h1>` representing the main title and subsequent headings indicating subsections. Meaningful and appropriately structured headings assist users in navigating your content and understanding its hierarchy.

By implementing these practices and following web accessibility guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), you can significantly improve the accessibility of HTML content for a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities.
